# x3-mod-autoclaimer
**X3TC and/or X3AP mod to allow players to claim derelict ships by flying close to them, without the need to exit their playership.**

Normally, you have to exit your ship and go on a spacesuit trip to claim derelict ships; you are also limited to claiming smaller ship classes only (TM/TP/M3-M5).

With this mod, you just need to fly your ship sufficiently close to the derelict and bring it to a complete stop to claim it, regardless of class.

## Gameplay Changes

- Once installed, simply fly close to a derelict ship and bring your ship to a complete stop.
- If all conditions are met (the target ship belongs to no faction and has no pilot), your on-board software suite will claim the ship for you.
- No need to exit your ship, and it works with ships of any size.
- How close you need to be depends on the size of your playership: 300m for M3-M5/spacesuit, 800m for M6/TM/M8, 2000m for M7 and larger.

## Differences from similar mods

There are quite a few other mods that do similar things (e.g. the Salvage Suite, or the System Override Software Mk. 2). I wanted a very simple and easy solution for my playership without having to mess with new wares that might create compatibility issues, new hotkeys or menues. My mod does only what it's supposed to do with negligeable performance impact.

## Installation

Extract the `.zip` file.

Then copy the `script` folder into:
- the base game directory (in the case of X3TC) or
- into the `addon` folder under the base game directory (in the case of X3AP).

You need to have tagged your game as ***modified*** (a lot of other mods do this already), otherwise check the web for instructions (keyword 'Thereshallbewings').

## Update

Same process as installation:
- Copy files into the scripts folder
- Overwrite when asked

## Activation/Deactivation

When installed, the script automatically activates. If you want to deactivate it for a time, or to reactivate it again, you can do so via:
> **Options → Gameplay → Artificial Life → Autoclaimer**

## Uninstallation

Turn off the autoclaimer as described above, wait a little (30s) and save. You can then safely delete the script files and reload your save.

## Compatibility

Usable with X3TC and AP, regardless of version (make sure to use the correct folders though, as described in "Installation")
No conflicts with other mods.
